# Notes
This tracks my progress as I learn about PySpark and conduct some hands-on exercises. Most if not all of these exercises were created by others. This repository was created to track my own learning, as well as code tweaks where necessary (eg package changes, when packages are deprecated). By consolidating my learning, I hope to be able to find techniques and code that can also be used in my day-to-day work. 

Do note that this project works with PySpark, and uses the direct PyPi installation using Pip. My current role does not need me to download Apache Spark, Scala, Java and the other systems for a local run. That, however, is something I plan to learn in the near future.
